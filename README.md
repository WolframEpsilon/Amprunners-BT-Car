The goal was to build two cars from scratch, control them wirelessly using:
* Bluetooth module (as used in model APEX)  
* Mobile BT App (seen in model NOVA)

## ðŸ’» Code
Main features of the code:
- Reads instructions from BT module/App.  
- Controls motors' speed (3 in each direction) via H-Bridge.
- Control steering via servo motor (front wheels) + one hobby motor (rear wheel)   
- Stops when obstacles are detected by ultrasonic, then starts beeping.
- Beeps periodically when backing up (like big trucks)
- Toggling on/off headlights and buzzer (horn)
- Reverse and Tail lights light up automatically according to movement

## Chassis & Assembly 
Our team agreed on making the car RWD, rather than AWD; simply because it was more economical

> Using [this model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4772279) made by Pammeg80 on Thingiverse.com as our inspiration , with some slight adjustments

#### Alterations to base model:
1. Made a small hole using SolidWorks to fit the pins for the ultrasonic sensor
-![Ultrasonic Hole adjustment](docs/U-Hole.png)

2. Removed the 9V power at the back, while mounting the 12V pack (mentioned here) under the model 
-![9V removal](docs/bye9V.png)

3.  Adding a nameplate for visuals with a "THOMAS" text ingravement + LED Holes 
-![Thomas Nameplate](docs/Nameplate.png)

4. Small pillars to hold headlight's LEDs (Not saved unfortunately)

## Testing
### Phase 1: Wiring test
This was done by adding a Keyboard (of varing resistance) to one analogue pin, and manually taking resistance reading to form a resistance-to-key map.
The following map was created:

```cpp
//Keypad Resistance Map//
#define ast_KEY 47
#define zero_KEY 51
#define hash_KEY 57
#define seven_KEY 60
#define D_KEY 64
#define eight_KEY 68
#define nine_KEY 79
#define four_KEY 85
#define C_KEY 93
#define five_KEY 102
#define six_KEY 128
#define one_KEY 146
#define B_KEY 171
#define two_KEY 205
#define three_KEY 341
#define A_KEY 1023

#define keyPin A1 //where i received the key strokes
```

Analogue pins are know to give a range of values due to external factors, like temperature changes messing with the resistance reading
So a tolerance range was added to compensate for this error as shown in this function:

```cpp
//funcion for reading the keypad-resistance configuration//
char KeypadReading() {
  int val = analogRead(keyPin);

  // sorted in ascending order with tolerances of 2~4//
  if (val < 44) return 0;  //null if not in range//  
  else if (val < 49) return '*';
  else if (val < 53) return '0';
  else if (val < 59) return '#';
  else if (val < 62) return '7';
  else if (val < 66) return 'D';
  else if (val < 70) return '8';
  else if (val < 82) return '9';
  else if (val < 88) return '4';
  else if (val < 96) return 'C';
  else if (val < 105) return '5';
  else if (val < 132) return '6';
  else if (val < 150) return '1';
  else if (val < 175) return 'B';
  else if (val < 210) return '2';
  else if (val < 345) return '3';   
  else if (val > 1000 && val <= 1023) return 'A';

  return 0; //again, null if not in range//
}
``` 


### Phase 2: Joystick Implementation
Using a potentiometer (10K Ohm) for steering control, and another (10K Ohm) for motor speed we constructed the following circuit:
-![Potentiometer circuit](docs/PotPic.png)   

and controlled their movement using the code below: 
```cpp
  int steer = map(analogRead(steerPot),0,1023,0,180); //joystick reading for servo
  int drive = map(analogRead(hobbyPot),0,1023,0,255); //joystick reading for motor
  
  Serial.print("steer= ");
  Serial.print(steer);
  Serial.print("||drive= ");
  Serial.println(drive);
  
  //-----front and back in 3 levels each-----//
  if(drive == 128) {  // ~centered
    digitalWrite(backLED,HIGH);  //not moving
    digitalWrite(reverseLED,LOW); //reverse-light off
  }
  else if(drive > 128){ //going forwards
    forwards(drive); 
    digitalWrite(backLED,LOW); //break-light off
    digitalWrite(reverseLED,LOW); //reverse-light off
  }
  else if(drive < 128){ //going backwards
    backwards(drive); 
    digitalWrite(backLED,LOW); //break-light off
    digitalWrite(reverseLED,HIGH); //reverse-light on
  }

  //-----right and left-----//
  steerMotor.write(steer);
```

## Challenges (and how we overcame them)

## 1. 12V power to 5V Arduino:
#### Issue:
>* Feeding 12V into the arduino power plug would instantly fry the circuit
>* using multiple power sources would be inefficient and require extra wiring complexity
>* Linear voltage regulator need comprehensive understanding (in a small time period)
### Solution: H-bridge power supply
Surprisingly, the **L293D H-Bridge** model has a neat feature activated by adding a jumper cap to a built-in voltage regulator; allowing +12V power to motors and feeding just 5V from it's power slot (normally used to power the module itself)

## 2. H-bridge driving wheels incorrectly
This manifested as both RWD motors being able to move backwards, but motor A (left) failing to drive forwards
#### Cause: 
>Instability from mechanical vibration of motors; resulting in lose conections
#### Solution: Physically fixing connections and insulation
using a hot soldering iron and lead, we were able to Solder connections well, and prevent shorts using Heat shrink tubing at exposed locations


## 3. Car wheels not fitting into chasis
#### Cause:
>no tolerances added during modelling; which lead to an impossible interference fit
#### Solution: Tolerance adjustment 
fortunately, we had a drill bit that was exactly the same size as the wheel, so we manually drilled through 


## 4. Irresponsive Bluetooth Pair (with remote control)
#### Cause:
>modules aren't always recognised by smart devices at specific ports, and won't go into pair or AT mode when enabled by pin
#### Solution: Changing baud rate 
It's more of a compatability problem across devices where serial communication is set out of sync, eg. 9600 baud Uno with 11600 BT module

## Other challenges
- Servo motor torque limitations occasionally caused unintended steering drift (sometimes leading to unplanned donuts ðŸ˜…)
  -![Thomas going wild](docs/Drifting.gif)

- Connecting pins and general wiring in the chassis; which is an extremely small area, sometimes inaccessible without t6aking the whole thing apart again

- Weak arduino pin connection, affected by the motors' vibration 

- Exposed wiring <small> (in future improvements) </small>
  -![Exposed](docs/Exposed.jpg)

## Future Improvements
### 1. Using an ESP32 MCU
- Built-in BT and WiFi
- More pins and faster clock speed
- Smaller footprint in an already crammed area
### 2. 3D Printing the car's original body
We didn't have the time to assemble this part withing the deadline, but we do have the model (pulled from Rocket League by [Paul Ashley on GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/library/all-rocket-league-car-object-files-a-few-bonus-s-1)):
  -![Body](docs/Body.jpg)
### 3. Backwards Obstacle Detection
reducing impact possibility, thus improving lifespan 
### 4. Surface-mounted robotic arm  
for object transportation, perhaps in warehouses
### 5. Infrared light sensor
for line follower feature
### 6. Camera Module
for object distinction or QR code scanning
