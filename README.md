## ðŸ’» Code
Main features of the code:
- Reads instructions from BT module/App.  
- Controls motors' direction & speed (3 in each direction) via H-Bridge.  
- Stops when obstacles are detected by ultrasonic.
- beeps periodically when backing up (like big trucks)   
- toggle on/off lights and buzzer


#### *Code Snippet*
```cpp

void loop() {

  //-----ultrasonic--------
  digitalWrite(trigPin,LOW);
  digitalWrite(trigPin,HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(trigPin,LOW);
  
  time= pulseIn(echoPin,HIGH);
  distance= 0.0343*(time/2);
  
  if(distance<=35){stopFlag=true;}
  else{stopFlag=false;}
  //-----------------------

  if (Serial.available()) {
    read = Serial.read();
    if (read != '0' && read != 'o' && read != 'U' && read != 'D') {
      lastcommand = read;
    }

# Chasis & Assembly 
Our team agreed on making the car RWD, rather than AWD; simply because it was more economical

> Using [this model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4772279) made by Pammeg80 on Thingiverse.com as our inspiration , with some slight adjustments

#### Alterations to base model:
1. Made a small hole using SolidWorks to fit the pins for the ultrasonic sensor
-![Ultrasonic Hole adjustment](docs/U-Hole.png)

2. Removed the 9V power at the back, while mounting the 12V pack (mentioned here) under the model 
-![9V removal](docs/bye9V.png)

3.  Adding a nameplate with the text ingravement "THOMAS" as our first prototype 
-![Thomas Nameplate](docs/Nameplate.png)

##### you can view the model [here](models/APEX&NOVA/Final_THOMAS.SLDASM) along with the rest of the parts for both models

# Testing
### Phase 1: Wiring test
This was done by adding a Keyboard (of varing resistance) to an analogue pin, and using the code map below to test input:

```cpp
//Keypad Resistance Map//
#define ast_KEY 47
#define zero_KEY 51
#define hash_KEY 57
#define seven_KEY 60
#define D_KEY 64
#define eight_KEY 68
#define nine_KEY 79
#define four_KEY 85
#define C_KEY 93
#define five_KEY 102
#define six_KEY 128
#define one_KEY 146
#define B_KEY 171
#define two_KEY 205
#define three_KEY 341
#define A_KEY 1023

#define keyPin A1
```
then using the following function toreturn the keypad values:

```cpp
//funcion for reading the keypad-resistance configuration//
char KeypadReading() {
  int val = analogRead(keyPin);

  // sorted in ascending order with tolerances of 2~4//
  if (val < 44) return 0;  //null if not in range//  
  else if (val < 49) return '*';
  else if (val < 53) return '0';
  else if (val < 59) return '#';
  else if (val < 62) return '7';
  else if (val < 66) return 'D';
  else if (val < 70) return '8';
  else if (val < 82) return '9';
  else if (val < 88) return '4';
  else if (val < 96) return 'C';
  else if (val < 105) return '5';
  else if (val < 132) return '6';
  else if (val < 150) return '1';
  else if (val < 175) return 'B';
  else if (val < 210) return '2';
  else if (val < 345) return '3';   
  else if (val > 1000 && val <= 1023) return 'A';

  return 0; //null if not in range//
}
``` 
#

### Phase 2: Joystick Implementation
Using a potentiometer (10K Ohm) for steering control, and another (10K Ohm) for motor speed we constructed the following circuit:
-![Potentiometer circuit](docs/PotPic.png)   

and controlled their movement using the code below: 
```cpp
  int steer = map(analogRead(steerPot),0,1023,0,180); //joystick reading for servo
  int drive = map(analogRead(hobbyPot),0,1023,0,255); //joystick reading for motor
  
  Serial.print("steer= ");
  Serial.print(steer);
  Serial.print("||drive= ");
  Serial.println(drive);
  
  //-----front and back in 3 levels each-----//
  if(drive == 128) {  // ~centered
    digitalWrite(backLED,HIGH);  //not moving
    digitalWrite(reverseLED,LOW); //reverse-light off
  }
  else if(drive > 128){ //going forwards
    forwards(drive); 
    digitalWrite(backLED,LOW); //break-light off
    digitalWrite(reverseLED,LOW); //reverse-light off
  }
  else if(drive < 128){ //going backwards
    backwards(drive); 
    digitalWrite(backLED,LOW); //break-light off
    digitalWrite(reverseLED,HIGH); //reverse-light on
  }

  //-----right and left-----//
  steerMotor.write(steer);
```

# Challenges (and how we overcame them)

## 1. 12V power to 5V Arduino:
#### Issue:
>* Feeding 12V into the arduino power plug would instantly fry the circuit
>* using multiple power scouces would be inefficient and require extra wiring complexity
>* Linear voltage regulator need comprehensive understanding (in a small time period)
### Solution: H-bridge power supply
Surprisingly, the **L293D H-Bridge** model has a neat feature activated by adding a jumper cap to a built-in voltage regulator; allowing +12V power to motors and feeding just 5V from it's power slot (normally used to power the module itself)

## 2. H-bridge driving wheels incorrectly
This manifested as both RWD motors being able to move backwards, but motor A (left) failing to drive forwards
#### Cause: 
>Instability from mechanical vibration of motors; resulting in lose conections
#### Solution: Physically fixing connections and insulation
using a hot soldering iron and lead, we were able to Solder connections well, and prevent shorts using Heat shrink tubing at exposed locations


## 3. Car wheels not fitting into chasis
#### Cause:
>no tolerances added during modelling; which lead to an impossible interference fit
#### Solution: Widenning hole with DIY machining
fortunately, we had a drill bit that was exactly the same size as the wheel, so we drilled through 


## 4. Irresponsive Bluetooth Pair (with remote control)
#### Cause:
>modules aren't always recognised by smart devices at specific ports, and won't go into pair or AT mode wgen enabled by pin
#### Solution: Changing baud rate 
It's more of a compatability problem across devices where serial communication is set out of sync, eg. 9600 baud Uno with 11600 BT module
